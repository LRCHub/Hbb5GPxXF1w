Put on your hi-heel sneakers,
And wear your wig hat on your head, yeah
Put on your hi-heel sneakers,
And wear your wig hat on your head
I'm pretty sure my baby
I know, I know, I know
You're gonna knock 'em dead

Put on your red dress baby
We'll be going out tonight
Put on your red dress babe
We'll be going out tonight
And take along some boxing gloves
In case some fool might start a fight

Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
You know you always realised
You know, you know, you know
You're gonna knock 'em dead

Put on your hi-heel sneakers
I said we're going out tonight
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
I said we're going out tonight
And take along some boxing gloves
In case some fool might start a fight
